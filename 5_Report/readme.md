# Title: Car parking Detection Using Sensors
* This Project Detects the Car Signals in the parking area it shows the available parking slot to park The Car.
* It is Designed with Arduino Mega,LCD,LED(Green and red)and IR sensors With Proteus Simulation software.
* Arduino Mega able to read inputs - Detects And Read The sensor. It was Programmed With arduinoIDE Software.
* An infrared sensor (IR sensor) is a radiation-sensitive optoelectronic component with a spectral sensitivity in the infrared wavelength. IR sensors are now widely used in motion detectors.Which used In this Project to detect car signals By IR sensors And Send the data to Arduino.
* LCD - Dispays the Availbility OF the Parking slot .
